# Code-Cheer-Advent-Calendar
A festive programming journey to express my passion for my favorite holiday of the year. I am creating a small Python3 project every day of December lead up to Christmas. Each day brings a new challenge, blending software development with holiday joy. Join me as I count down to Christmas with creativity and code!
